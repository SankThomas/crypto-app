# About this project

See the demo project [here](https://tsbsankara-crypto-app.netlify.app/)

This is a demo project for a cryptocurrency application built using `create-react-app` and the `coingecko api`. [Visit the API](https://coingecko.com/api/documentation)

## Running the app

1. Clone the repo using `git clone` or download the `zip` file for the repo.
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal - in the same folder as your cloned repository, or extracted files.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

## What can the app do

1. Fetches data for 100 cryto coins and displays them to the user - responsive of course.
2. Click on individual coins to view more data about them. Routing is done using `react-router-dom`

### Known issues

1. Sometimes you won't see any data for the single coin page. Working to fix this with improved error boundaries.
